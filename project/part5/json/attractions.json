    "longDescription": "Fun Land is located directly on the Rehoboth Beach boardwalk, in perfect walking distance from a number of other attractions. Whether you just came from the beach or just want a fun activity to do with your family, Fun Land lives up to its name by providing tons of fun. With many different rides, for all ages, along with different arcade games for the whole family to play, there is so much to do. At fun land, you will not get bored. The family can stay and play for hours and still not have explored everything they have to offer. With a fun team of staff members, different activies, lots of prizes, and even better carnival food, everybody has to check out this place at least once! The only tip I have is to make sure that you bring your wallet with you as Fun Land works on tickets that you have to purchase with cash or a debit card. When you arrive at the park, just visit one of the carnival style booths to buy a pack of tickets to get your day of fun started."
