            <p>
              Delaware is a very small state (only about 2.5 hours from the
              northern-most to southern-most points). Comprised of three
              different counties you can easily get anywhere you want to via
              car. Depending on what you're looking for, one might want to spend
              their time in one county over the other. New Castle County is home
              to the Christiana Mall and the City of Wilmington, both great
              places to shop with Delaware's tax free shopping. Kent County is
              the home of Dover, the state's capital filled with exciting
              history, and Sussex Country is the home of the beaches, with great
              views and a relaxing vibe you are destined to have fun.
