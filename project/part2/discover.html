The state's history is also marked by its position as a center for commerce and industry, particularly in shipbuilding, manufacturing, and agriculture. Throughout its history,  Delaware has been known for its emphasis on individual rights and governance, which contributed to its decision to be a first adopter of the U.S. Constitution. Delaware's rich history is reflected in its many historic sites, museums, and landmarks, making it a fascinating destination for those interested in early American history.</p>
