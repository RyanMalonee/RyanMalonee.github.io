        <h1>My Dogs: Otis and Sully</h1>
        <p class="sep12">I have two dogs, one is named Sully and the other is Otis. These
            dogs have been in my life for a long time and I love them. Sully
            is a giant saint bernard and Otis is a basset hound. Both of them
            are super friendly, but will constantly beg for your attention.</p>
        <p>Both Sully and Otis are very lazy dogs. Normally, you can find both
            of them sleeping on the couch or the floor. Even though they are
            lazy, they still love to be around people and will follow you inside
            and out. There were many times this summer that I went in my pool and
            they would follow me out and just sunbathe on my deck.</p>
