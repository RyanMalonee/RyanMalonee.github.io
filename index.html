              This assignment consisted of us configuring our website to show
              the name of the class, our names, a class description, and a list
              of our assignments.

              In this assignment, we begin to style our main page and the
              assignment 2 page using CSS. We modified colors, fonts,
              background, etc. using CSS.

              This assignment consisted of creating 2 pages using one index.html
              file. The page contained two exercises (an age comparison tool and
              a donation goal chart). We then used javascript to make the 2
              exercises work and to show only one exercise at a time.

              This assignment involved making a picture of a man walking/running
              switch back and fourth while moving across it's div box. It also
              made a fundraising thermometer graphic fill based on user input.
              Intervals in JS were used to make both these functionalities work.

              In this assignment, we were tasked with building a site with two
              activities, both of which utilized arrays. The first activity
              changes quotes every 2 seconds from an array of quotes, and the
              second activity draws a rainbow row-by-row (every second) and
              places a pot-of-gold at the end of it.

              over a toy, its information will be displayed.

              information on this site was a list of movies with different bits
              of information about them and it was all gathered from a JSON
              file.

              and hosted it on render.

              In this assignment, we were tasked with further developing our
              website so that the information about the activities and
              attractions in Delaware were gathered entirely from a JSON file.
              This allowed the form to submit new activities and attractions to
              the website to operate successfully.
